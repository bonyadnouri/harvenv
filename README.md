# harvenv

**Harness virtual environments for Claude Code.**

harvenv makes a Claude Code harness configuration a reproducible property of a project — the way uv makes a Python environment one. A committed manifest (`harvenv.toml`) declares the skills, agents, commands, settings, MCP servers, plugins, and system tools a project needs; `harv sync` materializes them from a machine-global store; `harv claude` launches hermetic sessions that load exactly the declared environment — your teammate clones the repo and gets the identical harness, out of the box.

- Same manifest → same harness → same output quality, across teammates and CI.
- Personal staples survive through a declared, uncommitted overlay — nothing loads by accident.
- No config-dir tricks: isolation is a launch recipe of native Claude Code flags. Your login, history, and MCP auth are never touched.

## Status

Design phase. The domain language lives in [CONTEXT.md](./CONTEXT.md); the decisions and their trade-offs live in [docs/adr/](./docs/adr/). The implementation plan is the issue tracker — issues are thin vertical slices in dependency order.
